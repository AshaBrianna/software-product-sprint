                I'm passionate about many topics and fields including computer science, technology, design, and social justice. I love channeling my artistic creativity and utilizing both math and science to discover real-world solutions! I especially welcome opportunities to work collaboratively and represent and advocate for underrepresented communities. I'm currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science, and considering a minor in either Visual Art Practice, Graphic Design, or Economics.

                    While I also enjoy back-end design, I love the artistic aspects of frontend design and UX Engineering. In addition to graphic and product design, I also love expressing myself artistically through mediums like painting, drawing, watercolors, and ink prints. While most of my work is for fun, I also take commissions. A portfolio-style collection of some of my artwork can be viewed on by art website. </td>
